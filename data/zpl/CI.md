# ZPL Command: ^CI (Change International Font)

## Description
Zebra printers can print fonts using international character sets: U.S.A.1, U.S.A.2, UK, Holland, Denmark/Norway, Sweden/Finland, Germany, France 1, France 2, Italy, Spain, and several other sets.

The ^CI command enables you to call up the international character set you want to use for printing. You can mix character sets on a label. This command allows character remapping. Any character within a font can be remapped to a different numerical position.

## Format
```
^CIa,s1,d1,s2,d2,...
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **a** | Desired character set | 0 = U.S.A. 1<br>1 = U.S.A. 2<br>2 = U.K.<br>3 = Holland<br>4 = Denmark/Norway<br>5 = Sweden/Finland<br>6 = Germany<br>7 = France 1<br>8 = France 2<br>9 = Italy<br>10 = Spain<br>11 = Miscellaneous<br>12 = Japan (ASCII with Yen symbol)<br>13 = IBM Code Page 850<br>14 = 16-bit (Unicode) encoded scalable fonts<br>15 = Shift-JIS for scalable Japanese fonts<br>16 = EUC-Kanji for scalable fonts<br>17 = Unicode (for Unicode-encoded fonts)<br>18 to 23 = Reserved<br>24 = 8-bit access to Unicode-encoded fonts<br>25 = Reserved<br>26 = Asian fonts with ASCII Transparency | 0 |
| **s1** | Source 1 (character output image) | Decimals 0 to 255 | - |
| **d1** | Destination 1 (character input) | Decimals 0 to 255 | - |
| **s2** | Source 2 (character output image) | Decimals 0 to 255 | - |
| **d2** | Destination 2 (character input) | Decimals 0 to 255 | - |
| **...** | Continuation of pattern | Up to 256 source and destination pairs can be entered | - |

## Examples
This example remaps the Euro symbol (36) decimal to the dollar sign value (21) decimal. When the dollar sign character is sent to the printer, the Euro symbol prints:

```
^CI0,36,21
```

The font selected determines the shape and resolution of the printed symbol.

## Important Notes
- ^CI 13 = US keyboard
- The space character cannot be remapped for any font
- The encoding for parameter 14 is controlled by the conversion table (*.DAT). The table generated by ZToolsâ„¢ is the TrueType font's internal encoding (Unicode)
- Shift-JIS encoding converts Shift-JIS to JIS and then looks up the JIS conversion in JIS.DAT. This table must be present for Shift-JIS to function
- Parameter 26 now supports ASCII transparency for Asian fonts. 7F and less are treated as single byte characters. 80 to FE is treated as the first byte of a 2 byte character 8000 to FEFF in the encoding table for Unicode. Entire range is available for double byte characters
