# ZPL Command: ^B8 (EAN-8 Bar Code)

## Description
The ^B8 command is the shortened version of the EAN-13 bar code. EAN is an acronym for European Article Numbering. Each character in the EAN-8 bar code is composed of four elements: two bars and two spaces.

### Key Features
- Supports a fixed ratio
- Field data (^FD) is limited to exactly seven characters
- ZPL II automatically pads or truncates on the left with zeros to achieve the required number of characters
- When using JAN-8 (Japanese Article Numbering), the first two non-zero digits sent to the printer are always 49

## Format
```
^B8o,h,f,g
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **o** | Orientation | N = normal<br>R = rotated 90 degrees (clockwise)<br>I = inverted 180 degrees<br>B = read from bottom up, 270 degrees | Current ^FW value |
| **h** | Bar code height (in dots) | 1 to 32000 | Value set by ^BY |
| **f** | Print interpretation line | Y = yes<br>N = no | Y |
| **g** | Print interpretation line above code | Y = yes<br>N = no | N |

## Important Notes
- Field data must be exactly seven characters
- Automatic padding/truncation with zeros on the left to meet character requirements
- For JAN-8 applications, ensure first two non-zero digits are 49
