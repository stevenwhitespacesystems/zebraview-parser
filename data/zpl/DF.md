# ZPL Command: ^DF (Download Format)

## Description
The ^DF command saves ZPL II format commands as text strings to be later merged using ^XF with variable data. The format to be stored might contain field number (^FN) commands to be referenced when recalled.

While use of stored formats reduces transmission time, no formatting time is savedâ€”this command saves ZPL II as text strings formatted at print time.

Enter the ^DF stored format command immediately after the ^XA command, then enter the format commands to be saved.

## Format
```
^DFd:o.x
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **d** | Device to store format | R:, E:, B:, and A: | R: |
| **o** | Format name | 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters | If a name is not specified, UNKNOWN is used |
| **x** | Extension | .ZPL (fixed value) | .ZPL |
