# ZPL Command: ^B2 (Interleaved 2 of 5 Bar Code)

## Description
The ^B2 command produces the Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code, a high-density, self-checking, continuous, numeric symbology.

Each data character for the Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code is composed of five elements: five bars or five spaces. Of the five elements, two are wide and three are narrow. The bar code is formed by interleaving characters formed with all spaces into characters formed with all bars.

### Features
- Supports print ratios of 2.0:1 to 3.0:1
- Field data (^FD) is limited to the width (or length, if rotated) of the label
- For additional information about the Code 11 bar code, visit www.aimglobal.org

## Format
```
^B2o,h,f,g,e
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **o** | Orientation | N = normal<br>R = rotated 90 degrees (clockwise)<br>I = inverted 180 degrees<br>B = read from bottom up, 270 degrees | Current ^FW value |
| **h** | Bar code height (in dots) | 1 to 32000 | Value set by ^BY |
| **f** | Print interpretation line | Y (yes) or N (no) | Y |
| **g** | Print interpretation line above code | Y (yes) or N (no) | N |
| **e** | Calculate and print Mod 10 check digit | Y (yes) or N (no) | N |

## Important Notes
- The total number of digits in an Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code must be even
- The printer automatically adds a leading 0 (zero) if an odd number of digits is received
- The Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code uses the Mod 10 check-digit scheme for error checking
- For more information on Mod 10 check digits, see ZPL II Programming Guide Volume Two
