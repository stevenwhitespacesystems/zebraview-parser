# ZPL Command: ^B7 (PDF417 Bar Code)

## Description
The ^B7 command produces the PDF417 bar code, a two-dimensional, multirow, continuous, stacked symbology. PDF417 is capable of encoding over 1,000 characters per bar code and is ideally suited for applications requiring large amounts of information at the time the bar code is read.

The bar code consists of three to 90 stacked rows. Each row consists of start and stop patterns and symbol characters called code-words. A code-word consists of four bars and four spaces. A three code-word minimum is required per row.

### Key Features
- Fixed print ratio
- Field data (^FD) is limited to 3K of character data
- Capable of using structured append option (^FM) to extend field data limitations
- Can encode over 1,000 characters per bar code

## Format
```
^B7o,h,s,c,r,t
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **o** | Orientation | N = normal<br>R = rotated 90 degrees (clockwise)<br>I = inverted 180 degrees<br>B = read from bottom up, 270 degrees | Current ^FW value |
| **h** | Bar code height for individual rows (in dots) | 1 to height of label | Value set by ^BY |
| **s** | Security level | 0 = error detection only<br>1-8 = error detection and correction | 0 |
| **c** | Number of data columns to encode | 1 to 30 | 1:2 (row-to-column aspect ratio) |
| **r** | Number of rows to encode | 3 to 90 | 1:2 (row-to-column aspect ratio) |
| **t** | Truncate right row indicators and stop pattern | Y = perform truncation<br>N = no truncation | N |

## Special Considerations for ^BY with PDF417
When used with ^B7, the ^BY command parameters are:

| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **w** | Module width (in dots) | 2 to 10 | 2 |
| **r** | Ratio | Fixed value: 3 | 3 |
| **h** | Height of bars (in dots) | 1 to 32000 | 10 |

**Note:** PDF417 uses the ^BY height parameter only when row height is not specified in the ^B7 h parameter.

## Special Considerations for ^FD with PDF417
The character set includes the full ASCII set, except for characters with special meaning to the printer.

**Special character handling:**
- `\&` = carriage return/line feed
- `\\` = backslash (\)
- `^CI13` must be selected to print a backslash (\)

## Important Notes
- If both columns and rows are specified, their product must be less than 928
- No symbol is printed if the product of columns and rows is greater than 928
- No symbol is printed if total code-words are greater than the product of columns and rows
- Serialization is not allowed with this bar code
- The truncation feature can be used in situations where label damage is not likely
- Security level determines the number of error detection and correction code-words generated
- You can specify number of code-word columns to control symbol width
- You can specify number of symbol rows to control symbol height
- Height multiplier number multiplied by the module equals the height of individual rows in dots
- A value of 1 is not recommended for height multiplier
- For structured append information, see ^FM command documentation
