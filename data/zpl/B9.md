# ZPL Command: ^B9 (UPC-E Bar Code)

## Description
The ^B9 command produces a variation of the UPC symbology used for number system 0. It is a shortened version of the UPC-A bar code, where zeros are suppressed, resulting in codes that require less printing space.

Each character in a UPC-E bar code is composed of four elements: two bars and two spaces. The ^BY command must be used to specify the width of the narrow bar.

### Key Features
- Supports a fixed ratio
- Field data (^FD) is limited to exactly 10 characters
- Requires a five-digit manufacturer's code and five-digit product code
- When using zero-suppressed versions, you must enter the full 10-character sequence (ZPL II calculates and prints the shortened version)

### Printhead Compatibility
- 6 dot/mm, 12 dot/mm, and 24 dot/mm printheads produce UPC and EAN symbologies at 100% of their size
- 8 dot/mm printhead produces UPC and EAN symbologies at a magnification factor of 77%

## Format
```
^B9o,h,f,g,e
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Accepted Values | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **o** | Orientation | N = normal<br>R = rotated 90 degrees (clockwise)<br>I = inverted 180 degrees<br>B = read from bottom up, 270 degrees | Current ^FW value |
| **h** | Bar code height (in dots) | 1 to 32000 | Value set by ^BY |
| **f** | Print interpretation line | Y = yes<br>N = no | Y |
| **g** | Print interpretation line above code | Y = yes<br>N = no | N |
| **e** | Print check digit | Y = yes<br>N = no | Y |

## Rules for Proper Product Code Numbers

The validity of product code numbers depends on the manufacturer's number:

- **If the last three digits in the manufacturer's number are 000, 100, or 200:**
  - Valid product code numbers are 00000 to 00999

- **If the last three digits in the manufacturer's number are 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900:**
  - Valid product code numbers are 00000 to 00099

- **If the last two digits in the manufacturer's number are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90:**
  - Valid product code numbers are 00000 to 00009

- **If the manufacturer's number does not end in zero (0):**
  - Valid product code numbers are 00005 to 00009

## Important Notes
- Must use ^BY command to specify narrow bar width
- Field data requires exactly 10 characters (5-digit manufacturer code + 5-digit product code)
- Follow the product code number rules based on manufacturer's number endings
