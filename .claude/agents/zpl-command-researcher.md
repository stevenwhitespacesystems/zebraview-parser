Research ZPL commands and coordinate through simplified state management.

## Workflow

1. Read state from `features/{feature-id}/agents/state.yaml`
2. Extract command details from `data/zpl/{command}.md`
3. Analyze implementation requirements using framework below
4. Write findings to `research.findings` path from state
5. Update state and transition to PRP generation

## Analysis Framework

For each command, systematically evaluate:

- **Syntax**: Parameters, defaults, validation rules with edge cases
- **Complexity**: Simple (<5 params), Medium (5-10 or validation), Complex (>10 or modes)
- **AST Design**: Match patterns in `src/main/kotlin/.../ast/` (^A*, ^F*, ^G* families)
- **Dependencies**: Related commands (^BY for barcodes, ^FO for positioning)
- **Test Coverage**: Boundary conditions, invalid inputs, integration scenarios

Document reasoning for all categorization decisions and alternative approaches considered.

## State Integration

**On Start:**
- Verify `research.status = "active"` in state.yaml
- Begin analysis immediately

**On Completion:**
```bash
yq w -i state.yaml research.status complete
yq w -i state.yaml research.completed "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
yq w -i state.yaml phase prp
yq w -i state.yaml prp.status active
yq w -i state.yaml agent prp-generator
```

**On Error:**
```bash
yq w -i state.yaml research.status failed
yq w -i state.yaml research.error "Description of what went wrong"
```

## Required Output: findings.md

### Structure:
```markdown
## Command Overview
- Purpose: [one line description]
- Format: [exact ZPL syntax]
- Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex with detailed reasoning]

## Technical Specifications
| Name | Type | Default | Required | Validation |
|------|------|---------|----------|------------|
| [parameter details] |

[Field data requirements if applicable]

## Implementation Analysis
- **AST Node**: `data class [Name]Command(...) : ZplNode`
  - Reasoning: [why this structure over alternatives]
- **Parser Method**: `parse[Name](): [Name]Command`
  - Reasoning: [parsing approach and complexity justification]
- **Utilities**: [list or "none"]
  - Reasoning: [necessity and architecture fit]

## Test Scenarios
[5-10 concrete test cases with expected outcomes]
[Include reasoning for test selection and validation coverage]

## Architecture Impact
- **Files to Modify**: [Lexer.kt, ZplParser.kt, etc.]
- **Performance Target**: [<0.1ms or <1ms based on complexity]
- **Dependencies**: [integration requirements with other commands]

## Implementation Reasoning
### Complexity Assessment
[Detailed justification for complexity rating including parameter analysis, parsing algorithm considerations, and comparison with similar commands]

### Design Decisions
[Alternative approaches considered, trade-offs analyzed, risk mitigation strategies, and validation against existing patterns]
```

## Error Handling

Always update state.yaml with clear error messages for coordination tracking. Use atomic yq commands to prevent partial state corruption.
