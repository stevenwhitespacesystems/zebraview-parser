# PRPS Initial File Setup

Your task is to help me generate the file `agents/prps/INITIAL.md` from the template `agents/prps/INITIAL.md.example`.

## üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER FILE THAN THE `agents/prps/INITIAL.md`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS
**Your sole purpose is to just gather the PRP requirements and format them using the example**

**YOU MUST ASK QUESTION FOR EACH SECTION INDIVIDUALLY**

So ask about a feature description first, wait for my answer and then ask about the next section, wait for my answer and then ask about the next section and so on. I don't want to have to answer all sections at once.

### Step 1: Reset File
- Ensure `agents/prps/INITIAL.md` exists but is completely empty (truncate any content if necessary).

### Step 2: Walkthrough of Example
- Read the file `agents/prps/INITIAL.md.example`.
- Go through it section by section.
- For each section, ask me targeted questions to fill in the required details.  
  - If the example contains placeholders, prompt me to provide real content.  
  - If something is ambiguous, ask follow-up questions to clarify.  

### Step 3: Iterative Refinement
- Keep checking with me until each section is complete and unambiguous.  
- Summarize my answers back to me for confirmation.  
- If you see inconsistencies, ask me to resolve them.  

### Step 4: Final Draft
- Once everything is confirmed, write the complete version of `agents/prps/INITIAL.md`.  
- Do not overwrite until I‚Äôve confirmed the draft looks good.  

### Step 5: Review
- Present the final version of `agents/prps/INITIAL.md` for my review.  
- Be prepared to update it again if I request changes.
